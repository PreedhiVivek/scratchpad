This document has notes on our group discussion about how to change rules for new employees. Specifically, this document outlines ideas about:

1. What rules/conditions should we add for our next new hire?
> E.g.: Work on alternate Saturdays for the first 2 years

2. What should we do with the extra bandwidth?
> E.g.: Should go to colleges on Saturdays and conduct workshops

----

## Summary:

a) We will be asking more of new hires paired with a more stringent evaluation criteria. 

b) The 'more' is not directly in terms of time but in terms of what they contribute back.

c) In general, everyone still wants to be be kind. Everyone stayed fair to the potential new hires which is good to see. 

d) Nobody really suggested cutting out any perk they really value and then make the new hire earn it conditionally. There does not seem to be any support to this approach. 

e) We all had many ideas that we can ask new hires to contribute back.

## Ideas

_Rohini_
1. ?? Mandatroy blog posts every month, mandatory present domain knowledge from previous jobs, 
2. Independent project and build it. 

_Raji_
1. Challenge with work + Evaluation system to eliminate. Two angles of evaluation: identify two problems will involve:
    a) making life for the next set of hires easy
    b) make life of existing employees easier
2. Come up with new internal tools?

_Mohan_
1. ?? No idea
2. Syllabus for faculty training program, build a new framework. If senior people join, they can evaluate our output, work on different testing tools and give demo, 

_Annapoorani_
1. Attend 2 conferences and webinars or paper published. Extra n-hours a week
2. Based on levels. E.g. Junior can build new tools/projects, Senioe can prepare some notes for others

_Avinash_
1. Extra 1-hour a day, monthly 2-3 additional tasks outside of work hours
2. Organizing meetups on our stuff (like our testing framework), present in conferences, building in other languages, ?work on unlearning stuff?, internal tools, youtube tutorials, complete a Udemy course, answering stackoverflow on company account, 

_Nilaya_
1. Optional to work extra 1 hour a day or on alternate Saturdays
2. Use extra bandwidth for tasks that have deadlines

_Raj_
1. 9 hours a day is good

_Shiva_
1. ??
2. Edting/maintaining blogs, newsletter, shadowing people, bring back from shadowing

_Smitha_
1. 9 hours a day
2. Involve them in work that employees are doing?
> Start with a R&D task and then do the training?
> Find out how close client work the onboarding is?
> Should we come up with other programs like senior training?

_RohanD_
1. Just task related (they can spend time)
2. Experienced hires have to conduct one session for employees, shadow employees 

_Preedhi_
1. Challenge them with work and not time
2. Explore more on happening tech, or internal tool, shadowing on a client is useful, conducting workshops at colleges, contirbute to training programs, 

_Indira_
1. ?? Different bandwidth for junior/senior/manager 
2. Upcoming trends, training other Qxf2 employees

_Kiran_
1. ??
2. Improve internal tools and contribute with newer ones

_Rahul_
1. Quantitative tasks (like x blogs in n months), time is on the individual
2. More on framework and any new ideas
