### Goal
Let's help people read errors quicker!

### Background
Many good engineers are able to process error logs and error messages at speeds much faster than beginners. It's almost as though they have trained their eye to do two things:

a) focus on what is important

b) ignore what is not important

### Your task:

a) Identify three error messages you have hit recently

b) If they can be reproduced, please reproduce them with a screen capture

c) If they cannot be reproduced, find some screenshots

d) Find a good gif maker

### Your output:
A clear gif that is less than 5-seconds long that shows the error.

### Notes:

a) [6-min] We collected 3 errors each

b) [10-min] We showed the errors by sharing our screen

c) [6-min] Looking for a gif tool

d) [15-min] Discussing a couple of errors and how the eye moves
