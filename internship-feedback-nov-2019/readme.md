## Feedback

### Raji:
a) N/A

b) N/A

c) Collect more data about jobs from interns
No survey system for interns. During and after internship. Are they placed? Are they applying? This will help us across and post internships. How did our internship help during interviews or land jobs? Or kind of difficulties post data? 

### Nilaya:
a) Assignment - how did the picking up new language go? Were they able to do by themselves? What issues did they face?
Pair programming was a good exercise. Even when talking to them, whatever they were doing, they were active on job hunts. 

b) Through pair programming and demos I got to know them. No clear picture.

c) We would like more feedback on how they pick up. 

### Akkul
a) I did not have much interaction with interns. My experience as an intern, the first two weeks was useful. Helped to get started in a new office environment. We are intially shy to ask questions on Skype. Resume review and paired programming were very helpful. Resume review helped me come up with a good resume. We get to know other employees through pair programming.

b) N/A

c) N/A

### RohanD
a) N/A

b) Usually when I review of their framework. That's when I can guess their grasping power. The other place is the paired programming. So ~week 3&4. 

c) N/A

### Rahul
a) N/A

b) I did demo for 3 sessions. I observed if they took feedback between sessions. I looked at thinking patterns. I was looking for gradual progression. This happened around 4th or 5th week.

c) Give them an independent application to test. If we have a new joinee page (e.g.: wiki page) and they log what they did and errors they did. They explored quite a lot. 

### Rohini
a) I had two sessions with them - demo + security testing session. Demos and GD sessions were helpful. A separate Skype channel for internship was useful. Interactions were more because of the channel. My session was not interactive. How do you compensate for missed sessions with genuine reasons?

b) N/A

c) We can explore online tools for resumes. Apart from tech training, there was lot of hesitation in talking and presenting ideas or making slides. Sessions on how to read articles. 

### Preedhi
a) I had only one demo which Nikhil could not join. From Skype channel it seemed like they were open. I felt positive vibes towards them. I was wondering if they were applying to the right kind of jobs. E.g.: why were they applying to other domains?

b) N/A

c) A consolidation of all internships will help us.

### RohanJ 
a) Continue with recruitment process. Look for non CS people. I found last batch of interns started applying a bit late ... like in the 7th or 8th paired programming session.  

b) Roughly after 3 weeks. 

c) Engage new people into group discussions. Make them contribute to public repos. Collect how their week was from them - blocks, problems. 

### Indira
a) I had a couple of mock interviews and a couple of demos. I was looking at how the feedback collected was used? 

b) I felt that in the first two weeks I was confident about Monoranjan. Around week 7th or 8th week I felt better about Nikhil. 

c) Can we give them a feedback form? 

### Mohan
a) I had 3 demos. I felt that level of interaction with Qxf2 employees was not much. So we did not get to know their potential. 

b) N/A

c) Add some more mock interviews. They should start applying for jobs earlier. It would be good to continue pair programming but expand the number of people who take the session.

### Raj
a) I did not interact much with them. I felt they were on track for landing a job. I felt they were technically good based on Skype channel.

b) N/A

c) We can have a mandatory feedback form.

### Kiran
a) I was looking at SKype channel. I was able to know that they were asking questions with an open mind. I was also looking at their Jira tickets. I felt it was good. 

b) N/A

c) N/A

### Smitha
a) I think recruitment is fine. There was a non-CS. The demo idea was good. The task of learning a new language and how they approach the problem helped me judge them better. The intern I worked with was not much of a talker. Should that be judged against our colleagues? I felt like Nikhil did well in my judgement and he changed. 

b) N/A

c) The feedback form did not give me any idea beyond a task based feedback. I did not feel like there was a clear indicator of how the interns were doing. 

### Avinash
a) I felt Nikhil was low on confidence but improved. But he could not get to the point where he was comfortable. The separate channels was good. The tech thing to solve was good. A lot more people helped with the internship but that spread the interactions thin. So continuity was missing.

b) 

c) I want a larger pool of candidates. I want to see 4 interns instead of 3. We need fallbacks like recordings if people miss sessions. Can we catch work habits in hiring itself? We need a better way to share indications of how the internship is going. We need something based on their interests too. Resume review + How to apply can help with getting a system.
