1. How did you know you were on the right track?
2. How did you know you were on the wrong track?
3. What did feel through the onboarding?


Rohini:
1. Comments on Jira tickets. Discussions on Skype based on doubts.
2. Discussion on Skype. 
3. Was not hands on previous company. Felt like I was not techie. It went off when there was more help. Discussion that most people had the same journey. Sprint calls were overwhelming. Pairing updates were bit intimidating. I was not sure if I was going to reach others update levels.


Sravanti:
1. I was able to complete Jira tickets on time. Whether whatever I learnt, I am able to retain and apply again. 
2. Comments on Jira. If I missed something obvious. 
3. Felt challenging. Coding in Python was new. Mine was mostly technical and so it had less interaction. If I had more time, I would have explored more. 

Rahul:
1. Time bound tickets and see if I could complete. Comments and approaches shared on Slack - was my approach similar?
2. Similar to point 1. 
3. Did not have much experience on technical things. I enjoyed learning new stuff. Time crunch. I couldn't compare it with earlier onboardings because it had more technical stuff. I felt like if we had more time on the Framework that would have helped. Updates on Trello card reduced fear and updates were helpful. Explain what is a 'failure' from a practical/R&D perspective.   

Preedhi:
1. Time suggestions. If the ticket is totally unrelatable, I have framed my questions and put it in Skype. Thumbs up/down helps. If I can finish tickets and progress.
2. I was hesitant to ask on Skype and Slack. Mental conflict - no clear indicator of whether to ask or not. Once the culture made me feel at ease and there were discussions around it, it felt nice. Responses to first few questions helped.
3. 80% adrenaline rush. Tickets were nice. It was reassuring to come back from a break and made me feel good. Technical stuff was good and challenging. 20% was anxiety. When I put my status and I am stuck, I was not able to sleep. Spoke to colleagues (Raji, Smitha) about how to do better.
4. Having a buddy. More culture related tickets initially ... before technical work begins. E.g.: Communication patterns at the start.


Kiran:
1. Tickets had instructions. Applying learned concept reinforces right track.
2. If I take too much time, or ask the wrong questions, depends on the answers. 
3. Overwhelmed. In short span of time, I had to learn a lot. 

Akkul:
1. If I was able to complete the tickets in a given time. Some tickets have time mentioned. Apply inter-related knowledge. Weekly demos. 
2. Answers on Slack, if I took too much time. 
3. I felt I took more time. The tickets were somewhat familiar. I got to learn many new tech in a short span of time.

Raj:
1. Being able to apply inter-related knowledge. Support from Rohini and Mohan. 
2. If I consume too much time. Or if I feel I am not making progress - either in understanding or take too much time. Answers on Skype.
3. Time feels short. Interesting to learn new things. Spoke with Rohini about being stressful.
