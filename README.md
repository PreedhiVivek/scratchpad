This is a collection of group code exercises that Qxf2 does every two weeks. We do not expect this repo to be useful to anyone outside of Qxf2


## How to use this repo (for Qxf2 employees)

a. If you are leading the Tuesday 14:00 meeting:
  1. Fork this repo
  2. Create a directory for yourself in the root
  3. Merge whatever code you want to share into that directory
  4. Add a README inside your directory with details ... DO NOT SKIP THIS!!
  5. Raise a PR to merge into master here
  6. You can then have everyone pull this repo when you start your exercise
  7. Each directory can have its own requirements.txt 

b. If you are playing along during the Tuesday 14:00 meeting:
  1. Pull this repo
  2. Switch to the right repo directory
  3. Where needed, create a virtual env within the exercise's directory
  4. Follow along
