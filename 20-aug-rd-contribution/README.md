# How can you continue contributing to R&D at Qxf2 when you are on a client?

Today is going to be a simple group disussion. I want to collect ideas from all of you on how you can contribute to R&D even when you are on a client. 

The problem I want to solve is twofold:

a. People see R&D and client work as different while in my head, both are the same

b. Most of us become super unimaginative and passive and repetitive when working with clients

In the first part of this discussion, each person gets 2-minutes to give their ideas. You can give your suggestions based on the following:

1. -- Some specific practice we can try
2. ** Difficulties or fears you have that prevent you from contributing to R&D today
3. >> Related problems that need to be solved (e.g.: we are poor at capturing ideas)

The second part of this discussion will be me discussing the ideas with everyone.


### Part 1

1. Indira
    ** Mindset (time constraints), old working style, narrower view of what is work
    -- learn from clients and their mindset
2. Raji
    -- when we see new tools at client, share it at Qxf2 (e.g.: cookie cutter)
    -- add tickets to ideas and problems 
    -- suggest pairing projects that have overlap with clients (but lower priorty for client)
    ** Mindset (time constraint), 
3. Annapoorani
    -- Like comment reviewer, give specific tasks per week
    ** Mindset (time constraint)
    -- Force people 
    >> Figure out better starting points, smaller examples that integrate with our framework
4. RohanD
    -- A paired project (e.g.: cookie cutter)
    -- Time box work better
    ** Mindset (time constraint, too many breaks)
5. Shiva
    >> When on client, we have very little idea of what happens on R&D
    -- We have regular sharing demos of R&D
    -- Client to R&D is the right flow of work
    ** Mindset, it takes time to get comfortable with a client
    ** Very little control at the client
6. Smitha
    -- We have time carved out for R&D 
    -- Project needs to be broken down 
    ** Mindset - the client sets the scope for what I learn 
    -- Meet as a SiLo group 
    -- Regular tutorials 
7. RohanJ
    ** Mindset (time constraint)
    -- Paired projects 
    >> R&D lists with smaller tasks 
    -- R&D sessions and demo sessions and idea gathering
8. Akkul
    ** Mindset (time constraint)
9. Rohini
    -- Tasks at client listed and we classify them (repetitive/common/R&D worthy,etc.)
    -- Blogging about new things at a client (internal maybe?)
    -- More time management discussions (via automated Slack messages?)
10. Mohan
    >> Breakdown R&D (make it small)
    ** Mindset (time constraints)
